#### About

A creative UI Designer and developer student with a passion for simplistic design, animation/interaction, problem-solving, and for mastering the latest front-end technologies.

I'm currently studying at [Yrgo](https://yrgo.se) to hopefully make use of my UI/UX knowledge in the coding world
and most importantly, to encourage good cooperation and communication between designers and developers.

Outside of work, I enjoy jogging in the woods, casual gaming and taking care of my house plants. ðŸª´
